#  starts on http://localhost:8000, and your default browser opens
#  the app. The window stays open so you can read errors instead

#
#  If pywebview is installed, a native desktop window is used
#  (desktop.py). Otherwise a browser tab is opened (run.py).
# ==============================================================

# IMPORTANT: do NOT use `set -e`. The user's .zshrc may source
# missing files (powerlevel10k etc.) that fail; we want the script
# to keep running anyway. Errors from python3 run.py are surfaced
# explicitly via the trap below.
